AES & RSA encryption application

I have developed an application based upon the RSA and AES algorithm that provides the encryption and decryption of the different files for one or more users at a time and the detailed description of the Design and implementation of application.

Application Design
This console cryptographic application developed using the python programming language.  For performing the Encryption/Decryption, I had used both AES symmetric and RSA asymmetric algorithms that performs the Encryption/Decryption of the different files. Plaintext in the files will be encrypted through the AES 256 bit key and after that I had used the RSA algorithm and the RSA algorithm provides the confidentiality because it generates the two keys: public key, which is available to everyone and is used for performing the encryption on the AES 256 bit key and the private key, which is only known to the receiver and is used for performing the decryption on the AES decrypted key.
